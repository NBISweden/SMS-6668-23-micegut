# Skeleton conda environment for RGI tool
# After this environment was installed with snakemake --conda-create-envs-only
# the environment was activated and biopython + rgi was installed using pip
# This was followed by patching the ConvertRGIJsonToTsv.py script to set
# hit_start and hit_end to 0 to circumvent a KeyError.
